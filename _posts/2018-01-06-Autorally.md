description: A Testbed for autonomous vehicles and machine learning research compatible with ROS
---

<a href="https://autorally.github.io">Autorally</a> is an open source research platform designed to take away the struggle of designing robust testbeds for other people studying the intersection of learning and robotics. All of its computing is onboard, and it is capable of going at around 8 m/s on a dirt track. This makes Autorally an especially good tool for studying high speed localization and planning. My lab, the Robot Learning Lab wanted two of these robots for us to run tests on and so I helped build them. Specifically, I put together and debugged the arduino based run-stop. I also assembled the steering servo assembly,  added better foam in the tires and configured all the computers to work as base stations.

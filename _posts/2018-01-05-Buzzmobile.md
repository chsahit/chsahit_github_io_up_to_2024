The Buzzmobile is the flagship project of <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>, the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Research Club at Georgia Tech. Its job was to be an autonomous parade float. My  role was integrating Gazebo, a robotics simulator, into the existing ROS framework. This was useful to the         organization as at the time, the robot itself was in the shop being repaired. I lead the project for a semester    coordinating efforts from both the Agency and <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>, the competitive   robotics team at Georgia Tech. I also added new Arduino code to operate the breaks upon receiving a message from the ROS interface. The source is <a href="https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile" target="_blank">here</a>.

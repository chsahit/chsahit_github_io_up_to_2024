<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>reshman year ended just a month and a half ago. It would be a good idea to write down what I learned as year 2 draws rapidly closer</p>

Wow, one year of my undergraduate experience at Georgia Tech is completed. I was just remined of something I was told at freshman orientation.

<blockquote>Georgia Tech breaks you down. But then it will build you back up.</blockquote>

I still haven't been completely broken down yet, so I can't fully attest to this statement's veracity. But I take this line way more seriously now than I did one year ago, and I see it coming in my future. My first and second semester were fundamentally different, so I'll address them one at a time.

### Semester One ###
I believe the function of my first semester was not so much academic, as it was to acclimate me to Tech and let me carve out a niche for myself. My courseload consisted of English Composition, Linear Algebra, Intro to OOP, Psychology, and Health. None of these classes was particularly challenging, but that's not to say I didn't learn a lot. Psych deserves a special shoutout for being my favorite class I took freshman year. Not only was my professor awesome (clear and friendly, what else could you want?) but the content was all incredibly interesting. Taking the class definitely forced me to redefine what a "soft science" was in my head. I also had time to pursue a little bit of art as we read both <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> by Haruki Murakami and <i>Ledfeather</i> by Stephen Graham Jones in English class. Both were really captivating and not like any other book I had read. On my down time I also read Machiavelli's <i> The Prince </i>, Arthur Clarke's <i>Childhood's End</i> and perhaps my favorite book of all time now, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>. I also learned how to play some of Vanessa Carlton's "A thousand miles!"

School aside, the real value of first semester was my chance to find my place on campus. Most of my friends were people I met either through the Honors Program at GT or through my involvement in extra curricular activities. I don't regret joining the Honors Program, its merit is not really in the stamp that goes on your diploma. What I love about HP is all the amazing people I met through it, including the kids who will be my roommates next semester. 

Now for my niche, I'm so happy I decided to take just 15 credits of straight forward courses, because I had time to explore what Tech had to offer outside of classes. By the end of the semester I had made friends in Georgia Tech's AI club(The Agency) and competitive robotics team(RoboJackets). Being a freshman again meant that I had found myself drowning in a new pool of things to learn but what I loved about both these orgs is that they care about your enthusiasm just as much as your technical experience. 

### Semester Two ###

So I'm binging <i>The IT Crowd</i>. Back to your regularly scheduled programming...

Semester two was a lot of firefighting, and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But the tempo definitely picked up relatively to first semester and I've never been so challenged before. Sure, this meant a lot more stress. But I've also amassed a wealth of knowledge over second semester that I simply didn't have before. First semester was meeting people and learning of new ideas. Second semester was getting to know those people and learning the ideas themselves.

The classes I took this semester were Multivariable Calc, Data Structures and Algorithms, Philosophy, Discrete Math, Objects and Design, and Research for credit. I've always thought of myself as a math person, and I still do. But calculus presented me with a level of difficulty I hadn't expected. I will say that I'm glad the class made me struggle, because I'd rather understand how to the struggle earlier. Data Structures also presented me with a similar problem, but it hit way closer to home. There were times when I was like "I base my identity around being good at CS, and if I'm not doing as well in this class as my friends then what's the point?". It was quite a conundrum at the time. Looking back at it, I realize that I'm blessed to have friends who are so talented, because it encourages me to push myself harder. It also taught me that I can't control how good other people are at programming, but I can control how much effort I put into learning this stuff. 

The Agency (AI club) and Robojackets continued to dominate my time outside of class, but I'm better because of it generated a lot of fond memories. I also found time to pick up photography and start running more than I thought I could. Unsurprisingly, the hard part of photography isn't learning the technical details of how to operate fancy cameras, it's creating art that's worth capturing. And running more has paid off in spades, I have my best ideas after a good run and am healthier than I've ever been. I still have a long way to go. 

When I started my second semester, I had two goals. I wanted to be able to run a 5k without having to stop and walk and I wanted to contribute to open source software? Did I accomplish both of these goals? Kinda, I can and will do more. I can now run a 5k in a little under a half hour and I've opened an unmerged PR to scikit-learn Theano's CNN code as well as a merged PR to tensorflow's documentation. I very intentionally didn't set a goal about keeping a 4.0 because I realized that learning was important to me, but grades were relatively secondary; I wanted my goals to reflect that. Going forward into the fall, I think I'll set similar goals. I plan to race in an actual 10k, as opposed to just jogs by myself, and I want to finish it in less than an hour. I want to make a contribution to open source software that is more than just documentation, and I want it to be merged in. It should be interesting to see where this takes me.

## So why did I write this? ## 
Rereading this when I went to edit, I realized how corny this post was. But memory is a far more malleable medium than markdown (points for alliteration?). I hope that I can look back at this as a little time capsule buried at the end of freshman year, and take these lessons and apply them to sophomore year. If someone from the interwebs stumbles across this, particularly people thinking about going to school at Tech, maybe this could give them an idea of what that's like. Regardless, I'm just glad I'm once step closer to hosting a blog on my website and not a graveyard.

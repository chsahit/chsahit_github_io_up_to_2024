This robot was build by my high school robotics team <a href="https://mort11.org">MORT</a> for the 2016 <a href="https://firstinspires.org">FIRST</a> robotics competition: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOKzoHJDjA"> Stronghold</a>. The robot went all the way to the world championships in St. Louis in Missouri. I acted as software lead for the team where my responsibilities were twofold; training underclassmen in how to use Java as well as leading the development for the software on this robot.

The code is written in Java and is hosted <a href="https://github.com/mort11/2016-Robot">here</a>. We attempted to do Computer Vision with OpenCV but this code saw little time on the field. I wrote a lot of the controls for this robot. The back tail was running a standard PI controller. The wheel that shot out the ball was running a feed-forward PI controller. In autonomous mode the drive train ran a PID controller using input from both encoder and an IMU.

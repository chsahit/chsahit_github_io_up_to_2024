<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n which I welcome my new website into the world. Turns out webdev can be
super rewarding when a final product is sitting in front of you.</p>

<blockquote>Oops I did it again. I played with your heart. Got lost in the game. Oh baby baby</blockquote>

I cooked up a new wesbite because I was unhappy with the old one...again. Woohoo! 
I'm really excited because these posts are all going to be written
in markdown. This means I can spend more time focusing on content and less time on aesthetics. I plan to use this space
to write up my thoughts on interesting books I read, cool concepts I've learned, nice pictures I take or just general
updates on how things are going. I've been getting comfy with my DSLR (see the cover photo with the rubiks cube above) so
I really look forward to the photography part. For anyone who really wants to see all my old blog posts, my old website is still available on
<a href="https://github.com/chsahit/chsahit.github.io-old">github</a>. I look forward to sharing with you on this blog!

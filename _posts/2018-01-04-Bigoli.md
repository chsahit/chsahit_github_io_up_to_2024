description: Robojackets Entry into the 2017 Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition
---

Bigoli was designed to carry a human rider while being fully autonomous. During the competition, the robot would race itself for two laps while a human driver held a cup of water without spilling it. They also are holding a nerf gun to shoot targets on the course for extra points. 

I was software lead while this robot was being built. I helped write the start sign detector which used a hough transform to identify the circular stop sign. I also co-wrote the finish line detector and added that logic into the drive AI. This was done with ROS, C++, and OpenCV. Another contribution I made was adding the udev rules that allowed the computer to recognize our sensors.

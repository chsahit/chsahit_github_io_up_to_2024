    <h2 class="pageTitle" style="display:inline; width:100%; text-align:justify;"> Hi, I'm Sahit! I build intelligent robots.</h2>

        <p> I am a first year Ph. D student at <a href="https://eecs.mit.edu"/>MIT</a> in the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu"/>Learning and Intelligent Systems Lab</a>, supervised by Dr. Leslie Pack Kaelbing and Dr. Tomas Lozano-Perez. My interests span Motion Planning, Control, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, and Manipulation. This summer, I had the chance to intern as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://deepmind.com"/>DeepMind</a>, where I worked on curricula generation for manipulators as part of the robotics lab.</p>

        <p> I completed my undergraduate degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied Computer Science with concentrations in Intelligence and Theory. While at Georgia Tech I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Robot Learning Lab, directed by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/">Dr. Byron Boots</a>. My research focused on Model-Predictive Control and online motion planning. I also had the chance to take part in some amazing student organizations. I gave weekly lectures for <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>, Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates and was a software lead for <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>, Georgia Tech's competitive robotics team.</p>  
        
        <p> Previously, I studied footstep planning for humanoid robots with the <a href="http://sbpl.net">Search Based Planning Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholars</a> program. I was also an intern in the <a href="https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Robots Lab</a> at the University of Washington where I developed controllers for mobile manipulators. </p>
        
        <p>When I'm not playing with robots, I like to <a href="/books/">read</a>, listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/chsahit">music</a>, shoot photos, boulder, and play tennis/squash/ping pong. </p> </td>

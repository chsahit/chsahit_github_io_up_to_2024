    <h2 class="pageTitle" style="display:inline; width:100%; text-align:justify;"> Hi, I'm Sahit! I build intelligent robots.</h2>

        <p> I'm a third year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>

        <p>My interests include motion planning for robotics, reinforcement learning, and online learning algorithms. My research is currently in the <a href="https://robotlearning.gatech.edu">Robot Learning Lab</a> where I study the application of Gaussian Proccesses in real-time motion planning. Additionally, I work on understanding how we can use policy optimization methods for motion planning. </p>
        
        <p> Previously, I have worked with the <a href="http://sbpl.net">Search Based Planning Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholars</a> program. I am currently also affiliated with the <a href="https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Robots Lab</a> at the University of Washington where I was an intern for the summer of 2019. </p>
        
        <p> Outside of research, I take on the role of Internal Operations manager for <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>, Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates. I was formerly a software lead for <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>, Georgia Tech's competitive robotics team.</p>  
        
        <p>When I'm not playing with robots, I like to <a href="/books/">read</a>, listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/chsahit">music</a>, shoot photos, run, climb, and play tennis/squash/ping pong. </p> </td>

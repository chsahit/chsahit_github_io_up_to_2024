	<p class="intro">Hi there, I'm Sahit!</p>
        <p> I'm a third year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science.
        My interests include motion planning for Robotics, reinforcement learning and online learning algorithms.  I am secretary of <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>,
        Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates. I am a software instructor and former software lead for <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>. 
        My research is currently in the <a href="https://robotlearning.gatech.edu">Robot Learning Lab</a> where I look at the application of Gaussian Proccesses in real-time motion planning.
        When I'm not playing with robots, I like to read, listen to music, play tennis, shoot photos, and go for runs. </p>

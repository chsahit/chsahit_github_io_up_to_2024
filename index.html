    <h2 class="pageTitle" style="display:inline; width:100%; text-align:justify;"> Hi, I'm Sahit! I build intelligent robots.</h2>

        <p> I'm a recent graduate of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. While I was a student I took on the role of Internal Operations manager for <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>, Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates. I also  was a former software lead for <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>, Georgia Tech's competitive robotics team.</p>  
        
        <p>My interests include motion planning for robotics, reinforcement learning, and online learning algorithms. I studied these topics in the <a href="https://robotlearning.gatech.edu">Robot Learning Lab</a> where I worked on projects including using Gaussian Proccesses for online planning and Model-Predictive Control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p>
        
        <p> Previously, I have worked with the <a href="http://sbpl.net">Search Based Planning Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholars</a> program. I also interned in the <a href="https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Robots Lab</a> at the University of Washington where I was an intern for the summer of 2019. </p>
        
        <p>When I'm not playing with robots, I like to <a href="/books/">read</a>, listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/chsahit">music</a>, shoot photos, boulder, and play tennis/squash/ping pong. </p> </td>

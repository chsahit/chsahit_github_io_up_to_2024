    <h2 class="pageTitle" style="display:inline; width:100%; text-align:justify;"> Hi, I'm Sahit! I build intelligent robots.</h2>
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/me3.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">
        <p> I'm a third year studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>

        <p>My interests include motion planning for robotics, reinforcement learning, and online learning algorithms. My research is currently in the <a href="https://robotlearning.gatech.edu">Robot Learning Lab</a> where I look at the application of Gaussian Proccesses in real-time motion planning. I have also been looking into how we can use policy optimization methods for planning. Previously, I also worked with the <a href="http://sbpl.net">Search Based Planning Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University where I was a part of the 2018 cohort of <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Robotics Institute Summer Scholars</a>.</p>
        
        <p> I am secretary of <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>, Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates. I was formerly a software lead for <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>.</p>  
        
        <p>When I'm not playing with robots, I like to read, listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/chsahit">music</a>, shoot photos, run, climb, and play tennis/squash/ping pong. </p> </td>

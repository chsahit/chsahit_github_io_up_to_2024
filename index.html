        <p> Hi There, I'm Sahit! I'm studying CS at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science.
        I'm a big fan of robotics, math, and functional programming. I was born in Mount Olive, New Jersey, where I was lead developer for the
        <a href="https://mort11.org">Mount Olive Robotics Team</a>. I am Secretary of <a href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a>,
        Georgia Tech's Machine Learning research club for undergraduates. I am also a software lead on <a href="https://robojackets.org">RoboJackets</a>
        and help out with <a href="https://hack.gt">Hack GT</a>. My research is in the Robot Learning Lab where I study path planning.
        When I'm not coding away, I like to read, listen to music (Mostly lots of Taylor Swift), and play tennis. </p>

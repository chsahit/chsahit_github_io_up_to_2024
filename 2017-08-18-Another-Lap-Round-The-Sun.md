<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>'m 19 now. Woah! I'm almost not a teenager anymore, this is kinda crazy! But not that crazy, as Randall Munroe wrote</p>

<blockquote>It's weird how I'm constantly surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the most predictable thing in the universe</blockquote>

Anyways, as the summer is winding down I figure now is a good time for another post. I go back to school in just a few days, which is a little exciting and a little scary. I've made progress on a lot of the projects I'm working on this summer, but there's still a lot to do. Buzzmobile, the autonomous replica of GT's rambling wreck, finally (my bad) had the gazebo intergration I worked on merged into master at the beginning of the summer. At the end of the summer my fellow RoboJackets finished installing the rest of the hardware for the brakes onto the car and I added the necessary firmware on the arduino to listen to changes in the brakes. Also, my RoboJackets team and I competed at the International Autonomous Robotics Competition in Canada where we took home third. Basically, I got to spend a large chunk of my summer poring over ROS code. The only word that could describe that is "awesome". At the end of the summer I left Georgia to come back to my hometown in New Jersey where I could celebrate my birthday and catch up with my amazing friends at home.

I should say, working on both the RJ project or the agency were not where all of my hours went this summer. What enabled me to spend the summer in Georgia, where I had provided housing and disposable income was my internship at ViaSat, a California-based satellite company with an office in Atlanta that specializes in building antennas. I'll devote the rest of this post to talking about that experience.


### Reflecting on My Summer At ViaSat ###
(They didn't ask me to write this)
So the technical work I did at ViaSat isn't really worth a blog post, the culture on the other hand, was really cool. I felt that the attitude there was very YMMG. You decided how much to do, but once you made a commitment you were held to it. I feel like this hits the right balance from a leadership perspective. If you let your devs run free, a whole bunch of side efforts will be started but nothing will actually get done. If you have a SCRUM master tracking everyone down and adding artificial deadlines, quality of work goes down as stress goes up. It's nice to work in a big company where (in my own personal experience) the bureaucracy doesn't really inhibit you.
The Duluth location general manager said at the beginning of the internship that what brings interns back wasn't the company itself so much as the other coworkers. What made me enjoy working with my bosses was they were ok with me making mistakes, so long as I recovered fast and tried a new approach. Typically, Engineers have a problem where they know a lot of stuff and in trying to share it they push people out of the way; this wasn't a problem with our bosses. They existed as a resource for questions we have. 
One of the things I got out of ViaSat was learning that, Web Dev (Full Stack or not), is not for me.
